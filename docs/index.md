# EVA WebSocket Chat API

Welcome to the EVA WebSocket Chat API documentation. EVA is a real-time chat API service built with WebSocket technology, featuring conversation history, intelligent summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities.

## âœ¨ Key Features

**Real-time Communication**
: WebSocket-based instant messaging with low latency

**Intelligent Responses**
: AI-powered responses with emotional context and segmented delivery

**Conversation History**
: Persistent storage with automatic summarization for long conversations

**RAG Integration**
: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with automatic document search and source attribution

**Flexible Authentication**
: Multiple authentication methods to suit different platforms and use cases

**Emotional Context**
: Responses include emotional indicators (neutral, happy, excited, thoughtful, etc.) for enhanced user experience

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key

Contact your administrator to obtain your API key for authentication.

### 2. Choose Your Connection Method

=== "JavaScript/Browser"
    ```javascript
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://your-domain.com/ws', ['chat', 'your-api-key']);
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    import websockets

    extra_headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key"}
    ws = await websockets.connect('ws://api.example.com/ws', extra_headers=extra_headers)
    ```

=== "Quick Testing"
    ```bash
    wscat -c "ws://your-domain.com/ws?token=your-api-key"
    ```

### 3. Start Chatting

1. **Connect** to the WebSocket endpoint
2. **Start a conversation** by sending a `start_conversation` message
3. **Send messages** and receive intelligent, emotionally-aware responses
4. **Enjoy** the enhanced conversational experience!

## ðŸ“‹ Message Flow

The API follows a simple but powerful message flow:

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant EVA API
    participant AI Engine
    participant Document Store
    
    Client->>EVA API: Connect with authentication
    EVA API-->>Client: Connection established
    
    Client->>EVA API: start_conversation
    EVA API-->>Client: conversation_started
    
    Client->>EVA API: user_message
    EVA API->>Document Store: Search relevant docs
    EVA API->>AI Engine: Generate response with context
    AI Engine-->>EVA API: Segmented response
    EVA API-->>Client: message (chunk 1, emotion: thoughtful)
    EVA API-->>Client: message (chunk 2, emotion: excited)
    EVA API-->>Client: message (chunk 3, is_final: true)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes EVA Special

### Emotional Intelligence

EVA doesn't just respond with textâ€”it provides emotional context that helps create more engaging conversations. Whether the response is `excited` about a discovery or `thoughtful` about a complex topic, you'll know the tone.

### Smart Segmentation

Long responses are intelligently broken into chunks, each with its own emotional context. This allows for progressive display and better user experience.

### Automatic Context

The RAG system automatically searches and incorporates relevant documents into responses, with full source attribution so you know where information comes from.

### Conversation Memory

Every conversation is preserved with intelligent summarization, so context is maintained across sessions without overwhelming the system.
